# Swayambhu Archive

This is an archive-style website driven by OpenAI and Elastic Search that enables users to view an extensive collection of interviews and other videos of the people of Nepal.  

The archive seeks to preserve the rich history, culture, and stories of the Nepali people, and it serves this content to the general population for research and entertainment.  

Users can enjoy an easy-to-use UI and a robust search mechanism that allows the use of natural language and semantic queries, rather than just standard keyword.
