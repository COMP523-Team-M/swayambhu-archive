We help students set goals and succeed however they want to succeed as students. One of our top services is academic coaching, and it's designed to help students thrive, not just be successful here but be their best. It allows students to set goals, make action plans, and have a non-judgmental partner to help them follow through and be accountable for those goals.",

While each of these strategies might not work in every situation, the important thing is becoming much more strategic in approaching classes, tests, and projects. By having this broader range of studying capabilities, students will become even more effective and efficient.",

We work with students who are having a successful academic experience and might want to make some minor changes to their efficiency, for example. We also meet students who are having a difficult time and want regular coaching to learn better strategies, such as improving their biology test scores.",

When a student comes to tutoring, they'll be matched with a fellow undergraduate who has recently taken the class and is often recommended by the professor. The tutor is not only able to help as a guide for the subject matter but can also suggest study and test-taking strategies that have helped them succeed in the class. The Learning Center offers specialized STEM support for classes like chemistry, math, and biology.",

Every year, we talk to hundreds of students and ask the question, 'How many of you have one aspect of academic life you'd like to improve?' Everyone always raises their hand. The Learning Center is the place to put those thoughts and intentions into action and start making changes to be your best self as a student.",
